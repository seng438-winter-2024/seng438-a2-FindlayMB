# 1 Introduction

This lab offers students a comprehensive introduction to JUnit. The objective is to equip students with the essential skills to craft automated test code, by testing five different methods from the Range class (org.jfree.data.Range) and the DataUtilities class (org.jfree.data.DataUtilities). 

From the Range class, test cases were written for the functions:
1. intersect
2. constrain
3. combine
4. expandToInclude
5. contains

From the DataUtilities class, test cases were written for the functions:
1. calculateColumnTotal
2. calculateRowTotal
3. createNumberArray
4. createNumberArray2D
5. getCumulativePercentages

Test cases were carefully constructed to ensure that each function was thoroughly tested from all possible angles. The test cases were then used on the functions to determine any errors that the system may have.


# 2 Detailed description of unit test strategy

// including the input partitions you have designed


Base on reviewing the requirements for each method, we decided to carrying out and black box techniques equivalent class testing that partition inputs that will produce the same effect. This allows the entire input set to be covered and avoid redundancy and boundary value testing that focuses on values at or close to the boundaries of equivalent classes to check for errors in processing the input data. 

For Range Class (LB = Lower Bound of Test Range, UB = Uower Bound of Test Range, lower = Lower Bound of Input Range, and upper = Upper Bound of Input Range): 
1. 5 equivalent classes and 5 boundary value tests for Intersect Method : 
    1. Equivalent Classes:
        1. lower < LB and upper < LB
        1. lower < LB < upper < UB
        1. LB < (lower and upper) < UB
        1. LB < lower < UB < upper 
        1. lower > UB and upper > UB
    1. Boundary Value Tests:
        1. lower < LB and upper = LB
        1. lower = LB and LB < upper < UB
        1. lower = LB and upper = UB
        1. LB < lower < UB and upper = UB
        1. lower = UB and upper > UB
1. 3 equivalent classes and 2 boundary value tests for Constrain Method 
    1. Equivalent Classes:
        1. LB < test value < UB 
        1. test value < LB
        1. UB < test value
    1. Boundary Value Tests:
        1. test value = LB
        1. test value = UB
1. 7 equivalent classes and 2 boundary value tests for Combine Method
    1. Equivalent Classes:
        1. Two null ranges 
        1. One null and one normal range
        1. Range 1 partially in Range 2 
        1. Range 2 partially in Range 1
        1. Range 1 is within Range 2 
        1. Range 2 is within Range 1
        1. Range 1 and Range 2 do not intersect
    1. Boundary Value Tests:
        1. Range 1 UB = Range 2 LB
        1. Range 1 LB = Range 2 UB
1. 4 equivalent classes and 2 boundary value tests for expandToInclude Method
    1. Equivalent Classes:
        1. LB < test value < UB 
        1. test value < LB
        1. UB < test value
        1. null range
    1. Boundary Value Tests:
        1. test value = LB
        1. test value = UB 
1. 3 equivalent classes and 2 boundary value tests for Contains Method
    1. Equivalent Classes:
        1. LB < test value < UB  
        1. test value < LB
        1. UB < test value
    1. Boundary Value Tests:
        1. test value = LB
        1. test value = UB

For DataUtilities Class,

The above equivalent classes covered the entirety of the inputs including valid and not valid inputs, and extreme range of variables. 
Boundary value testing were used to check the value at the Test Range for Intersect Method and Constrain Method to check the boundary values such as values that is at the boundary. Using a combination of both equivalent class testing and boundary value testing allows us to cover all possible inputs to check for discrepancies from the requirement.

# 4 How the team work/effort was divided and managed

The team was split into pairs to conduct peer programming for unit test code.
Test cases for all 5 methods of the DataUtilities class was assigned to Finn-Javy, and 5 methods of the Range class was assigned to Sarah-Nick.
Each pair was also responsible for writing the Javadoc documentation of their respective tests.
Upon completion, we reviewed each other's tests to check for inconsistencies or defects in test methodology, as well as adherance to JUnit testing code standards.

# 5 Difficulties encountered, challenges overcome, and lessons learned

The first difficulty we encountered for this assignment was trying to sync our Eclipse Project with our Github remote repository to work consistently for everyone as development progressed.
Our primary challenge during unit test creation was creating adequate test cases for comprehensive coverage according to the requirements of boundary value analysis. 
At first we were unfamiliar with the best approach to properly deriving the domain of each input variable and equivalence classes, until we spent more time to review documentation of all the necessary Java libraries. 
This was especially the case when it came to utilizing Mocking to test DataUtilities, when under black box testing it is not known with certainty how the inherited classes of each method function. 
The lesson we learned from this experience was how to balance the benefits and drawbacks of the Mocking framework when developing effective unit test code.

# 6 Comments/feedback on the lab itself

This lab was more challenging than the first, but provided useful real-world insight into automated black box unit testing with the JUnit framework.

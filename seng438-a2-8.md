# 1 Introduction

This lab offers students a comprehensive introduction to JUnit. The objective is to equip students with the essential skills to craft automated test code, by testing five different methods from the Range class (org.jfree.data.Range) and the DataUtilities class (org.jfree.data.DataUtilities). 

From the Range class, test cases were written for the functions:
1. intersect
2. constrain
3. getUpperBound
4. getLowerBound
5. isCentralValue

From the DataUtilities class, test cases were written for the functions:
1. calculateColumnTotal
2. calculateRowTotal
3. createNumberArray
4. createNumberArray2D
5. getCumulativePercentages

Test cases were carefully constructed to ensure that each function was thoroughly tested from all possible angles. The test cases were then used on the functions to determine any errors that the system may have.


# 2 Detailed description of unit test strategy

// including the input partitions you have designed

# 3 Test cases developed

// write down the name of the test methods and classes. Organize the based on
the source code method // they test. identify which tests cover which partitions
you have explained in the test strategy section //above
